## Paper Scissors Stone Game

#### TODO

* Tests for Winner logic
* Create and use IO interface
* Review naming
* Review some of the classes. Some implementation is assuming knowledge of other classes rather than just methods. I don't like it and need to fix it.
* Extend to > 2 players? Not sure how this would work.
